            <p> This is the html code of my portfolio; I made it with a mobile phone, and it's kind of hard to code on a mobile phone because its screen is small.</p> 
            <p> I only know HTML and CSS, and I'm still learning Javascript.</p>
            <p> I really want to be a web developer, and I am willing to learn how to design and develop a website in Google Chrome and make my very own website.</p>

            <h2>Why i want to be a web dev?</h2>
            <p> It's because I want to design my own website and also I want to be a software engineer. But i want to learn on how to be a web dev first.</p>
            <p>I can only do this much, but it's still a progress to become a web developer.</p>
            <p>If I become a professional web developer, I want to earn a lot of money and achieve my dreams. And support my whole family.</p>
